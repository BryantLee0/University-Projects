YAMADA Website Project
In this assignment, the goal was to create an online shop website, which also has the requirement of having said pages : 
- "Homepage" 
- "About Us" 
- "Product Page"

These requirements were fulfilled in the making of the website.

HOMEPAGE Description
The outline of the page will be divided into 3 Main Divs, each representing the Header, content, and footer.
Note : The header and footer are used repeatedly for different pages.

About Us Description
The outline of the page also resembles that of the homepage, using 3 different divs to represent the header, content, and footer.

Product Page Description
The outline of the page is divided into 4 divs, each representing the header, content1, content2, and footer
The products (in this case the bikes) are placed into a div thats modified to use the container function. Using the function "Display : Flex", the products were able to easily adapt to any screen resolution/zoom
changes that happen to the website. By modifying the "flex" function, I was able to also modify the sizes for the  individual product boxes.
In the end, using a combination of the Display:flex function and the flex function to modify the spaces and size of the products was a good idea, since the page was easily adapting to any zoom/resolution changes that
happened to the website.
